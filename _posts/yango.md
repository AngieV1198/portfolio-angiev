# **Project Overview**

Yango is a ride-hailing service that gets people where they want to go quickly, safely, and affordably with the value promise of "low prices". They came a new business model of bringing together several independent transport companies and getting the service directly with them because they could serve legally and confidently services.

# **Approach**

I divided the re-design of experience in three phases:

Discovery, Needs & Ideation, Design decisions. 

**Discovery:** Competitors analysis, User research and User testing.

**Needs & Ideation:** Brainstorming & strategy development.

**Design decisions:** User flow, wireframes fidelity-screens.

# **Research and Discovery**

The resarch process for this project entailed to Competitors Analysis, heuristic analyses and User research.

I approached to opinions, commenst on Appstore, Playstore, social media to conduct need findings of the users more closely.

Goals:

- ⁠Discover hidden usability issues that prevent users from having an experience that fits with their needs. 
- ⁠Competitor analysis is the best way to understand how the current market is working, how Yango is incorporated, and how we are/will be different.
- ⁠Heuristic evaluation to determine best practices.
- ⁠Leverage findings to make design decisions.
