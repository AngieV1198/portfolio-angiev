# **Intro**

PETWATCH is a innovate App that enable monitoring your furry friend (cats and dogs) checking everything about his health like vital signs, its body and physical state, shortly what is happening at all times through a walking vest with sensors.

# **Challenges**

This investigation project had a lot of variables to analice because the software needed to recollect information that I need to show in a simple way given that have many software and medical technique words, at the same time I needed to known everything about his software and hardware to understand how function and convey a clear message.

Why not create an app available for cell phones? The goal was to enhance the experience and effectiveness of the service by exclusively offering it on smartwatches. Since cell phones are prone to numerous notifications and distractions, there is a risk of important alerts or notices about the pet's status being ignored. For this reason, the smartwatch ensures that the user's attention remains focused on the app.

This system is capable of sensing health variables in real time remotely, providing deeper and more professional care for the pet from anywhere.
